# Online Payments Fraud Detection

This Jupyter Notebook provides an analysis and model development for detecting fraudulent online payment transactions. Using the dataset provided by [RUPAK ROY](https://www.kaggle.com/rupakroy) on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rupakroy/online-payments-fraud-detection-dataset/data), the notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning model building.

## Contents
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and understanding the data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating and selecting important features.
- **Model Building**: Developing and evaluating machine learning models for fraud detection.
- **Conclusion**: Summarizing the findings and performance of the models.
